I'm regularly involved in the development, optimisation and evaluation of apps for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction, including the evaluation of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/2/288">digitally enabled personal carbon monoxide monitors and related smoking cessation apps</a>, the refinement of the content and design of <a href="https://drinklessalcohol.com/">the Drink Less app</a> and the evaluation of the popular Smoke Free app in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.14652">parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial</a>.
