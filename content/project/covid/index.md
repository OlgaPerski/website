During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I have co-led a <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/UJR2AW.15">living evidence review</a> (updated 12 times, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.15276">version 7</a> published in a peer-reviewed journal) on the association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality. Each update was shared directly with Public Health Englandâ€™s tobacco control team and Action on Smoking & Health. I have co-led a <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-846">case-control study</a> at a UK hospital site to examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous. I have contributed to a <a href="https://www.ucl-covid19research.co.uk/">large survey study</a> to gain a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on smoking, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241760v1">vaping</a> and alcohol consumption among UK adults. I have also led a rapid review and meta-analysis of interventions to <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjhp.12542">increase personal protective behaviours to limit the spread of respiratory viruses.</a>
