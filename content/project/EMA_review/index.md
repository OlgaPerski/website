I'm co-leading a large systematic review of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies targeting five public health-related behaviours, including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, dietary behaviours and sexual health-related behaviours. Findings from this review are expected to inform design decisions in future observational EMA studies.
