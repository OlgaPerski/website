abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS:
Smartphone applications (apps) hold promise for delivering tobacco smoking cessation support to large numbers of people at low unit cost. Smoke Free is an evidence-informed, widely used app that is highly rated by users. This study aims to assess its effectiveness compared with no support.

DESIGN:
Two-arm individually randomized controlled effectiveness trial.

SETTING:
Online trial with no restrictions on location.

PARTICIPANTS:
English-speaking smokers aged â‰¥ 18 years willing to make a quit attempt within 4 weeks from initial contact (n = 4990).

MEASUREMENTS:
The primary outcome measure is self-reported 26-week continuous smoking abstinence. Secondary outcome measures include quit attempts in the first 4 weeks post-randomization, 12-week continuous smoking abstinence and 26-week continuous smoking abstinence among those who made a quit attempt.

COMMENTS:
If it is effective, the Smoke Free smartphone app is an affordable and widely implementable intervention to help smokers to quit."
